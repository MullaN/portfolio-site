            <p>I graduated in 2013 from the University of Washington with a bachelor's degree in Applied Computational Math Sciences
                 with a focus on discrete math and algorithms. This major was a blend of mathematics and programming, offering 400 level courses on each.
                 After graduating from college, I entered into the pension accounting
                 field. At my last position I was given the opportunity to create Excel macros to assist the department in staffing
                 anaylsis and increasing clerk efficiency. When working on these macros I began to realize that I found programming a lot more fulfilling
                 than my current position. I continued on at the position, but during quarantine I had more time to really evaluate what would make me happy and 
                 decided that I should pursue a career change.</p><br />
            <p>In August 2020 I started the Software Engineering bootcamp at the Flatiorn School. The languages and frameworks covered were Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript
                and React, but I also learned how to think like a programmer and not be dependent on one language. I had a lot of fun throughout the course, meeting amazing people
                and getting to work on fun and interesting projects. I graduated in the beginning of December 2020 and have now began my job search.
