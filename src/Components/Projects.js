            <p>We Multiply is a game created for a the Minimalist Game Jam #1. This is my first full game created using the Unity engine. The requirements of the game jam
                were that to make a game with minimal visuals and audio which I thought was a perfect opportunity while still learning the enginge/C#. The gameplay consists of
                running away from red circle enemies and running to x1, x2, and x3 multipliers to create explosions that destroy enemies chasing you while giving you 1, 2, and 3 points
                per enemy destroyed. I learned a lot about Unity and C# during the project and look forward to doing more game jams in the future!

            <p>Fore the Record was my final project at the end of my Flatiron School bootcamp. This app was designed as a place to track scores for the 
                Golf with Your Friends computer game and also calculate your handicap. This React app utilizes Semantic UI for styling, React Router for client-side
                routing, and OpenID 2.0 to allow for logging in through Steam. The data is stored in a Ruby on Rails api backend.

            <p>Blob Life was a 2d platforming game created in vanilla Javascript utilizting HTML's canvas tag. This short little game was a lot of fun to make and I hope to have time to add to it in the future!
