            <p>Fore the Record was my final project at the end of my Flatiron School bootcamp. This app was designed as a place to track scores for the 
                Golf with Your Friends computer game and also calculate your handicap. This React app utilizes Semantic UI for styling, React Router for client-side
                routing, and OpenID 2.0 to allow for logging in through Steam. The data is stored in a Ruby on Rails api backend.

            <p>Blob Life was a 2d platforming game created in vanilla Javascript utilizting HTML's canvas tag. This short little game was a lot of fun to make and I hope to have time to add to it in the future!
